        However, finding it difficult to quickly search for recently-spotted birds in any region of the world,
        both on their website and mobile application, I combined Cornell's and Wikipedia's API to create a mini library. It's simple way to
        discover new birds anywhere in the world, along with an image and fact from Wikipedia.`,
