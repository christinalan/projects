        in Bronzeville, Chicago. From her research and work with elder community residents, we created a website modeled after the classic word game
        Mad Libs. By keeping the design simple and reminiscent of the game, the goal was to create an inviting atmosphere for Bronzeville community members to visit
        and contribute.`,
